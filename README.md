# BlenderTemplate - 3D animation oriented template for Blender.

My personal Blender template for creating 3D animations. The goal of this template is to create an organized, and simple workflow. 

## Organized collects for scenes, effects, characters and objects:
* Robust and separate collections for each character and scene. As well as seperate collections for static and interactive props and or scenes. Allowing you to easily organize a project.
* Hand tailored collections for different effects/effect types. Including but not limited to: Explosions, sparks, water simulations, gore/blood effects and camera effects (Overlays).
* Unique collections for lights, cameras, and the scene(s).

## Organized tabs tailored for animation:
* Enjoy tabs tailored towards scene layout, animation, 2D effects for layering ontop of your 3D scenes, and a robust rendering tab, to help you easily setup your renders.
* A state if the art AV tab for overlaying 2D images onto a camera, filling your creations with sound, and more!

## Free and Open-Source
* Access to the more exquisite artistic tools should never be behind a paywall. We believe in free and open access to any and all artforms. Which is why this project is Free and Open-Source under the highly permissive MIT liscense.
* Being Open-Source allows anyone to contribute at anytime, allowing for rapid development and improvement of the poject. This means you, and anyone else can help make this project the best it can be!
* Open-Source also allows anyone to freely audit this project to make sure it secure, and safe for all users.

## Made in the USA
* This projects commits are hand-typed in the USA. No AI such as ChatGPT is ever, or will ever, be used. This project is built with love and passion from real people.
* With being made in the USA, you can be confident in this project's reliablity and quality like no other.
